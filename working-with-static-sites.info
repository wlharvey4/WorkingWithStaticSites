Preface
*******

Because of the *benefits* static site generators offer, static sites
generators are used to run thousands of sites and are becoming the basis
for a broad *set of tools* that reach the casual developer and the
nontechnical content writer.

   It can be difficult to know which tools to choose and how to get
started.

   *That is the problem the authors hope to address in writing this
book.*  By providing *common scenarios* and insights on how to address
them, the authors hope to make it easier for anyone to create static
sites solutions and take advantage of the speed, flexibilty, and
security they offer.

Who this book is for
--------------------

   • This book is for web developers who are looking for a simpler way
     to build and deploy websites.
   • For developers with experience with dynamic app servers (like PHP,
     Node.js, and ColdFusion), this book will present a simpler
     alternative.
   • For developers who are still working with simple websites but need
     a way to make them more powerful.

   • Subsequent chapters focus on a specific type of site and uses this
     as a way of introducing different static site generators.
   • How to build a site
   • More advanced topics, such as adding dynamic elements back in,
   • Working with CMS
   • How to deploy and host a site
   • How to migrate from a dynamic site to a static one
