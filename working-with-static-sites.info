Preface
*******

Because of the *benefits* static site generators offer, static sites
generators are used to run thousands of sites and are becoming the basis
for a broad *set of tools* that reach the casual developer and the
nontechnical content writer.

   It can be difficult to know which tools to choose and how to get
started.

   *That is the problem the authors hope to address in writing this
book.*  By providing *common scenarios* and insights on how to address
them, the authors hope to make it easier for anyone to create static
sites solutions and take advantage of the speed, flexibilty, and
security they offer.

--------------------

   • This book is for web developers who are looking for a simpler way
     to build and deploy websites.
   • For developers with experience with dynamic app servers (like PHP,
     Node.js, and ColdFusion), this book will present a simpler
     alternative.
   • For developers who are still working with simple websites but need
     a way to make them more powerful.

1 Why Static Sites
******************

Why would static sites be a worthwhile option for today’s web?  This
chapter will explore some of the benefits of static sites before diving
into how the changing technology behind static sites (i.e., static site
generators—the topic of this book) are making them viable again.

File: working-with-static-sites.info,  Node: Benefits of Static Sites,  Next: Static Sites are _Fast_,  Up: Why Static Sites

1.1 Benefits of Static Sites
============================

Of the many reasons that static sites are coming back into fashion, two
stand out:

  1. Static sites are _fast_
  2. Statis sites are _secure_


File: working-with-static-sites.info,  Node: Static Sites are _Fast_,  Next: Static Sites are _Secure_,  Prev: Benefits of Static Sites,  Up: Why Static Sites

1.2 Static Sites are _Fast_
===========================

Website performance is critical.  Users tend to abandon sites that take
longer than three seconds to load (with a load time of under two seconds
being considered optimal for mobile).  Achieving this level of website
performance can be difficult.

   By their very nature, static sites load extremely fast.  This is
because every visitor is served the exact same HTML without the
bottlenecks caused by a server-side language, database, or any kind of
dynamic rendering.  Plus, static sites are extremely easy to cache and
serve via a content delivery network (CDN), making them even faster for
the end user.  In addition, once you eliminate dynamic rendering from a
database, you’ve eliminated numerous points of failure that often cause
sites to be unresponsive or completely fail.


File: working-with-static-sites.info,  Node: Static Sites are _Secure_,  Next: Other Benefits,  Prev: Static Sites are _Fast_,  Up: Why Static Sites

1.3 Static Sites are _Secure_
=============================

With a static site, there is no database to breach and no server-side
platform or CMS with unpatched vulnerabilities.  Static sites will not
eliminate every vulnerability, but they narrow the window of
opportunities available to any hacker and limit the amount of potential
damage if a hacker does gain access.


File: working-with-static-sites.info,  Node: Other Benefits,  Next: What Kind of Sites Can Go Static,  Prev: Static Sites are _Secure_,  Up: Why Static Sites

1.4 Other Benefits
==================

There are other benefits of static sites as well, including:

Flexibility
     You are not working within a CMS framework, so there are no
     limitations on how you can buidl your site.
Hosting
     Because there’s no need for a database or server-side language
     support, hosting a static site can be anywhere from inexpensive to
     completely free, depending on your needs.
Versioning
     Since a static site is made up of static files, it is extremely
     easy to track and coordinate changes using version control systems
     like Git and GitHub.

   With all of these benefits, why wouldn’t you choose to use a static
site?  Well, only certain kinds of sites can realisticly work as static
only.


File: working-with-static-sites.info,  Node: What Kind of Sites Can Go Static,  Prev: Other Benefits,  Up: Why Static Sites

1.5 What Kind of Sites Can Go Static
====================================

There are drawbacks to using static sites.

   • While some amount of dynamic data is possible on a static site that
     uses external API calls or third-party services, a static site is
     simply not suitable if you require large amounts of dynamic data or
     content personalization.
   • From a development and content contribution standpoint, static site
     generators (i.e., the tools frequently used to build static sites)
     can have a steep learning curve.
   • Deployment can be complex, making static sites less than ideal for
     content that changes frequently.

   Sites that tend to work best as static sites are content-focused,
infrequently updated (once or twice a day at most), and do not require a
high degree of user interaction or personalization.

   Here are some examples of types of sites that work well as static
sites:

Blogs
     This is the most common use case; many static site generators
     default to a blog template.  Blogs are content-focused by design
     and, in many cases, user interaction is limited to comments, where
     services like Disqus (https://disqus.com/) con fill the
     requirement.
